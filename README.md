This package implements a novel algorithm, following the work in [**"*On
generating power law noise*", Timmer, J. and Koenig, M., Astron. Astrophys. 300,
707-710 (1995)**][paper], which allows generating power law noise with arbitrary
dimensions and arbitrary exponents. An exponent of $\beta = 0$, $1$ and $2$ corresponds to
white, pink and red noise. The figure below demonstrates the difference between
them, by plotting the resultant time series, generated via `PowerLawNoise.jl`:

Here is another one, but this time we are simulating noise in two dimensions:

We can also go ahead and verify that the algorithm works by performing a linear fit to the logarithmic plot of the power spectrum of the noisy time series generated via `PowerLawNoise.jl`. Here, we do this for the case of red noise (that is, $\beta = 2.0$):

Install it by typing and running:

```bash
] add PowerLawNoise
```

in the Julia REPL.
